# Sprinkwell Mill - temperature and humidity in a converted building
## *Tomasz Waleciuk's end of Digital Futures Academy Capstone Project*

As an occupier of Apartment 93 in Sprinkwell Mill, I noticed that the ambient humidity in my flat is much higher than the maximum humidity level recommended in a healthy living environment. In winter, it did not really matter if the indoor temperature was kept at 18°C or 22°C. However, one day I decided to test how much it might cost to keep the whole flat at over 20°C for almost a full day, and realised that it cost me £15 a day. This totals around £450 a month for heating solely. It must be mentioned that I ran this test in the most expensive electricity time (prices doubled in around October 2022).
